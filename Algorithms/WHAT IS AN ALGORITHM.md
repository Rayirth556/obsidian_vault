An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transforms an input to an output 

## Fourier Transform
It is a mathematical operation that converts a function or a signal from the spatial/time domain into its constituent frequencies, revealing the amplitude and phase of each frequency component

Used in many fields like engineering, physics, and signal processing to analyze and manipulate signals, allowing us to understand their underlying frequency structure, filter out noise, and process information more efficiently.
